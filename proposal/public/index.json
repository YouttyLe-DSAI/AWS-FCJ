	"content": "AI Contract Intelligence SaaS AGREEME Automated Contract Analysis, Risk Detection \u0026amp; Suggestion System\n1. Summary This document presents a SaaS solution that leverages AI models to assist small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and individual users in reading, analyzing, and automatically generating contracts. The system uses OCR to extract clauses from user-submitted images or documents, after which the AI model detects potential risks and suggests more favorable modifications for the user.\nThe solution is deployed on the AWS platform using EC2, n8n, DynamoDB, Lambda, and Amplify, ensuring comprehensive security, modularity, and scalability.\n2. Problem Statement What’s the Problem? SMEs lack in-house legal expertise for reviewing contracts. Manual contract reviews are slow, inconsistent, and prone to human error. Legal consulting costs are high, preventing scalable document evaluation. The Solution An AI-assisted SaaS platform that:\nExtracts and classifies contract clauses automatically. Highlights potential legal risks with citation context. Suggests negotiation points and generates revised versions. Supports template-based contract drafting. Benefits and Return on Investment Category Description Efficiency Reduces contract review time from hours to minutes Cost Saving Lowers legal consulting cost by 60–70% Scalability SaaS deployment allows multi-tenant scaling Compliance Ensures consistent risk evaluation and legal citation tracking 3. Solution Architecture The system is orchestrated by AWS EC2, with automation through n8n workflows. All AI inference and OCR are handled by external APIs (OpenAI + DeepSeekOCR).\nAWS Services Used No. AWS Service Function 1 Amazon Route 53 Receives requests from the User and routes traffic. It points to both the Frontend (Amplify) and Backend (API Gateway). 2 Amazon WAF (Frontend Flow) A web application firewall service that filters malicious requests before they reach the frontend. 3 Amazon Amplify (Frontend Flow) A service for hosting, building, and deploying the web application (frontend) for the user. 4 Amazo API Gateway (Backend Flow) Receives API requests from the user, acting as the \u0026ldquo;gateway\u0026rdquo; for all backend business logic. 5 Amazon Cognito Called by API Gateway to authenticate and authorize users, ensuring only valid users can access the API. 6 AWS Lambda (Invoke) Triggered by API Gateway. This Lambda function executes a quick task, in this case, to call and trigger the main workflow. 7/8 EC2 An orchestration service that receives a command from Lambda (6) to start and manage the data processing workflow and a microservice called by n8n, specializing in the task of creating vector embeddings. 9 Amazon RDS A relational database service (like PostgreSQL, MySQL). The Embedding Service (8) connects to it to store or query structured data. 10 Amazon DynamoDB A NoSQL database service. The n8n (7) uses it to store or query data (e.g., metadata) at high speed. 11 Amazon S3 Raw An object storage service. The n8n (7) uses this to read or store raw data files. 12 AWS Lambda (Invoke) The n8n (7) calls another Lambda function to communicate with an outside AI API 13 External LLM APIs The Lambda function (12) calls a third-party API (e.g., OpenAI, DeepSeek) for language processing. 14 Amazon Secrets Manager The EC2 instances (7, 8) access this service to securely retrieve sensitive information (like API keys, database passwords). 15 Amazon CloudWatch A monitoring and logging service. The Lambda function (6) (and likely other services) sends logs and metrics here to track operations. 16 Gitlab (CI/CD Flow) Gitlab\u0026rsquo;s CI/CD system is automatically triggered by code changes, building and deploying the application to Amplify. 17 Amazon S3 Web Amazon Amplify uses this S3 bucket to store the static files (HTML, JS, CSS) of the web application after it\u0026rsquo;s built. Component Design Frontend (Amplify + S3) – UI for contract upload, risk visualization, and report generation. API Gateway + Cognito – Authentication and API access management. EC2 (n8n Orchestrator) – Runs workflow templates (WT-01 → WT-07), uploads and normalizes files to S3. RDS + DynamoDB – Store relational metadata and embeddings. AI API Integrations – Provide text extraction and reasoning logic. CloudWatch + Secrets Manager – Monitor health, rotate keys, and secure credentials. 4. Technical Implementation 4.1 Implementation Phases MVP (Local)\nn8n environment hosted with EC2 instance. Integration with external LLM APIs for OCR + contract analysis. Local DynamoDB instance for embedding storage. Manual API gateway mock for testing workflow end-to-end. Cloud Integration\nAmplify connected to GitLab repository for CI/CD pipeline. Configure Aurora (PostgreSQL) and DynamoDB for production. Integrate API Gateway + Cognito. Enable CloudWatch logging and WAF security layer. 4.2 Optimization For Production Utilize RDS read replicas to offload analytical queries. Optimize embedding retrieval with DynamoDB on-demand capacity. Cache intermediate LLM outputs to S3 for reusability. Enable autoscaling on EC2 for workflow workloads. Adopt CloudWatch alarms + notification through n8n hooks. 4.3 Technical Requirements Category Specification Programming Stack n8n workflows, Net.js 15 + TailwindCSS (Amplify) External APIs DeepSeek OCR, GPT-5 Storage RDS PostgreSQL, DynamoDB, S3 Orchestration EC2 instance (t4g.large) Security WAF, Secrets Manager, Cognito Monitoring CloudWatch + n8n Alert Hooks 5. Timeline \u0026amp; Milestones Phase Deliverable Duration 1 MVP backend (n8n + DynamoDB + OCR pipeline) 3 weeks 2 Contract risk analysis (GPT integration) 3 weeks 3 Revision \u0026amp; template generator 2 weeks 4 Full AWS deployment (Amplify + Cognito + EC2) 3 weeks 5 Monitoring, scaling, and pilot test 2 weeks 6. Budget Estimation Component AWS Service Monthly Cost (USD) Notes Frontend Hosting Amplify 3.68 DNS/Routing Route 53 2.04 Backend Compute EC2 25.79 User Database RDS for PostgreSQL 8.73 Vector Database DynamoDB 8.30 Storage S3 1.93 Request Routing API Gateway 1.29 Virtual Cloud VPC 28.52 AI API Usage OpenAI 5.00 Non-AWS User Authentication Cognito 1.00 Security Secrets Manager 0.94 Security WAF 6.60 Monitoring CloudWatch 0.53 Total Estimate 94.35 ~306/13 weeks Cost Optimization Most components use serverless and managed AWS services, minimizing idle resources and operational overhead.\nCompute: EC2 uses Graviton t4g.large with limited runtime (12h/day).\nDatabase: RDS t4g.micro and DynamoDB (50 GB) are right-sized for dev/test load, avoiding over-provisioning.\nStorage: Separate S3 buckets for raw data and web hosting keep data organized and cost-controlled.\nIntegration \u0026amp; Security: Use of HTTP API Gateway, single WAF rule, and one Route 53 hosted zone reduces costs.\nOverall monthly cost is around 65 USD, reflecting a well-optimized deployment.\n7. Risk Assessment Risk Likelihood Mitigation High API costs for LLM usage Medium Use caching, partial context retrieval Data privacy concerns Low Encrypt S3 and Aurora data with KMS Workflow errors or timeouts Medium n8n retry logic + CloudWatch alarms Vendor API change (OpenAI/DeepSeek) Low API abstraction layer for replacement Performance under heavy load High EC2 autoscaling and Aurora read replicas 8. Expected Outcomes 8.1 Technical Improvements End-to-end contract analytics pipeline deployed fully on AWS. Modular backend orchestration via n8n on EC2. Secure, CI/CD-driven workflow through Amplify. Scalable data handling with RDS + DynamoDB. 8.2 Long-term Value Enables SMEs to adopt AI-assisted contract intelligence affordably. Reduces dependency on external legal resources. Establishes groundwork for enterprise-level contract governance tools. "
