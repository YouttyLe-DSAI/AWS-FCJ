# AI CONTRACT INTELLIGENCE SAAS – AGREEME

# About the Team

**TEEJ** is a group of four Artificial Intelligence students from FPT University who share a strong passion for cloud computing, data systems, and the creative use of AI in solving real-world challenges.  
We joined the **First Cloud Journey (FCJ)** program organized by **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** to explore how cloud technology can empower the next generation of AI engineers.

For us, this internship is not just about learning tools or frameworks — it’s about turning ideas into practical, scalable, and meaningful products that make a difference.
